            Imagine you live in a town, and every house in the town has a unique address. This address helps people find your house when they want to visit you or send you something. In the world of the internet, devices like computers, smartphones, and servers also need unique addresses to communicate with each other. That's where IP addresses come in.
    
    IP stands for "Internet Protocol," and an IP address is like a digital version of a house address. It's a set of numbers assigned to each device connected to the internet, helping data find its way to the right destination.
    
    There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses look like a series of four numbers separated by dots, like 192.168.1.1. IPv6 addresses are longer and use a combination of numbers and letters.
    
    Just like your home address, IP addresses are used for different purposes. When you visit a website, your device uses the website's IP address to connect and fetch information. When you send an email, the email servers use IP addresses to locate and deliver your message to the recipient's device.
